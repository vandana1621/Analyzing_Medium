# Analyzing_Medium

## What is Medium?

<a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> is a blogging platform where writers and readers share their ideas. With a strong following in the tech community, it is a place where people can come to learn from professionals and industry experts. I began writing on Medium very recently, inspired to write about data-science and machine learning. For more information, check out my writing <a href="https://medium.com/@harrisonjansma">here.</a>

# This Project
In this project I collected data on 720K unique Medium stories from 36 of the most popular writing subjects. I used this data to answer the following questions.
1. What do I need to know about Medium as a writer and as a reader? (<a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Analyzing_Medium/blob/master/Medium_EDA.ipynb">source</a>)
2. Who are the top Data-Science writers on Medium? (<a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Analyzing_Medium/blob/master/Medium_Author_Leaderboard.ipynb">source</a>)
3. How can Medium writer's measure the performance of their stories? How can they compare their performance to that of similar writers? (<a href="https://github.com/harrisonjansma/Analyzing_Medium/blob/master/Medium_EDA.ipynb">source</a>)

This repository is a collection of everything I found while analyzing the data collected from Medium. I hope you think it as interesting as I do.


# My Findings
